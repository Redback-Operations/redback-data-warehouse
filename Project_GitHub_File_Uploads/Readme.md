# Project Dataset Uploads

This repository contains records of datasets uploaded into the **Redback Operations Data Warehouse** via the file upload service. The datasets originate from the public Redback Operations GitHub repositories and have been processed for:

- **Security & Privacy**: Sensitive or unnecessary raw files have been migrated out of public view.  
- **Repository Maintenance**: Cleaning up GitHub repositories by removing datasets once safely stored in the warehouse.  

---

## Completed Uploads

The following projects have been fully uploaded to the Data Warehouse:

- **Project 2**  
- **Project 3**

> Note: All datasets from **Project 2** have been deleted from the public GitHub repository after successful migration.

## Documentation

For detailed information about the Data Warehouse processes, storage, and access, please see the official documentation:

## Continuing This Work

To support future dataset uploads, a companion tool has been developed to track records of file uploads and processing steps:  
[GitHub Data Scribe](https://github-data-scribe.lovable.app/)

This software helps contributors record what has been uploaded, what preprocessing (if any) was performed, and ensures continuity for ongoing work.

---

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a **logbook and reference** for dataset migration efforts. It ensures:

- Transparency of what has been uploaded  
- Traceability for dataset lifecycle management  
- A clean and secure state for public-facing GitHub repositories
