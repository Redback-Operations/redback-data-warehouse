st.write("The Smart Bike VR project aims to transform indoor cycling into an immersive experience by blending virtual gamified challenges with real-time health and performance tracking. While the project has strong foundations from previous trimesters, it is currently inactive due to the team being unresponsive at this early stage. Despite the temporary pause, the project is expected to resume once the team re-engages in the coming weeks, allowing development to progress alongside Redback’s broader ecosystem initiatives. ")
